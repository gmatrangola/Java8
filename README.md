# Java 8

## Sample Project 

This project has many of the same patterns as the LABS. During class the instructor will push updates as I live code enhancements in functionality and improvements to the architecture.

### Overview

This is based on *Anil Pal's* [<https://github.com/anildi>] starter code. I changed it to use Gradle in instead of maven and changed the package structure slightly. The in-class live-coding will be different for this class than his (to match for the custom outline and class needs) so the end result will very from his.

The project represents a School data, it tracks students and courses. The starter data includes a data model (in the domain package), DAO (Data Access Objects), and service classes.  (Ignore the Track stuff for now)

## Labs - Student Project

The labs will have a completely different problem domain and model, but will follow a similar pattern. It's up to the students to apply the knowledge in class and patterns in the examples to their problem domain. The instructor will help as much as needed.

### Overview

The Student Project will track Inventory and sales for a store. Initially there will be two domain elements to model - Items and Customers. The Items will have a unique ID, UPC Code, Name, and Cost. The Customer will include a unique ID, name, phone number and email address.

### Activity

Students will create classes that model the Item and Customer, a DAO, and Service similar to the classes in this project. Students will also create test (either in Main or in unit tests) that initialize the data in the DAOs with valid-looking test values.

The code should follow standard Java Coding Standards. Correct capitalization, indention, etc. The code should be clear and commented better than the Starter set.
